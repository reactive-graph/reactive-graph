# Contributing

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## First Steps

If you're new, we encourage you to take a look at issues tagged
with [good first issue](https://github.com/reactive-graph/reactive-graph/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

## Code of Conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reactive-graph/reactive-graph/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It is in effect at all times. We expect it
to
be honored by everyone who contributes to this project.

## Opening an Issue

Before creating an issue, check if you are using the latest version of the project. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

## Reporting Security Issues

Review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/reactive-graph/reactive-graph/blob/main/SECURITY.md). Do not file a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

## Bug Reports and Other Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

In short, since you are most likely a developer, **provide a ticket that you would like to receive**.

- **Do not open a duplicate issue!** Search through existing issues to see if your issue has previously been reported. If your issue exists, comment with any
  additional information you have. You may simply note "I have this problem too", which helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

- **Prefer using [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)**, not comments, if you simply want to "+1" an
  existing issue.

- **Fully complete the provided issue template.** The bug report template requests all the information we need to quickly and efficiently address your issue. Be
  clear, concise, and descriptive. Provide as much information as you can, including steps to reproduce, stack traces, compiler errors, library versions, OS
  versions, and screenshots (if applicable).

- **Use [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).** Especially put code blocks and
  console outputs in backticks (```). This improves readability.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted. Your idea may be great, but also
out-of-scope for the project. If accepted, we cannot make any commitments regarding the timeline for implementation and release. However, you are welcome to
submit a pull request to help!

- **Do not open a duplicate feature request.** Search for existing feature requests first. If you find your feature (or one very similar) previously requested,
  comment on that issue.

- Be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it relates to existing features. Include implementation details if possible.

## Triaging Issues

You can triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports or asking for additional information, such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. Any
help you can provide to quickly resolve an issue is very much appreciated!

## Submitting Pull Requests

We **love** pull requests! Before [forking the repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
and [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests)
for non-trivial changes, it is usually best to first open an issue to discuss the changes, or discuss your intended approach for solving the problem in the
comments for an existing issue.

For most contributions, after your first pull request is accepted and merged, you will
be [invited to the project](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
and given **push access**.

*Note: All contributions will be licensed under the project's license.*

- **Smaller is better.** Submit **one** pull request per bug fix or feature. A pull request should contain isolated changes pertaining to a single bug fix or
  feature implementation. **Do not** refactor or reformat code that is unrelated to your change. It is better to **submit many small pull requests** rather than
  a single large one. Enormous pull requests will take enormous amounts of time to review, or may be rejected altogether.

- **Coordinate bigger changes.** For large and non-trivial changes, open an issue to discuss a strategy with the maintainers. Otherwise, you risk doing a lot of
  work for nothing!

- **Prioritize understanding over cleverness.** Write code clearly and concisely. Remember that source code usually gets written once and read often. Ensure the
  code is clear to the reader. The purpose and logic should be obvious to a reasonably skilled developer, otherwise you should add a comment that explains it.

- **Follow existing coding style and conventions.** Keep your code consistent with the style, formatting, and conventions in the rest of the code base. When
  possible, these will be enforced with a linter. Consistency makes it easier to review and modify in the future.

- **Include test coverage.** Add unit tests when possible. Follow existing patterns for implementing tests.

- **Add documentation.** Document your changes with code doc comments or in existing guides.

- **Update the CHANGELOG** for all enhancements and bug fixes.

- **Use the repo's default branch.** Branch from
  and [submit your pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the
  repo's default branch (`main`).

- **[Resolve any merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)** that
  occur.

- **Promptly address any CI failures**. If your pull request fails to build or pass tests, please push another commit to fix it.

## Code Review

- **Review the code, not the author.** Look for and suggest improvements without disparaging or insulting the author. Provide actionable feedback and explain
  your reasoning.

- **You are not your code.** When your code is critiqued, questioned, or constructively criticized, remember that you are not your code. Do not take code review
  personally.

- **Always do your best.** No one writes bugs on purpose. Do your best, and learn from your mistakes.

- Kindly note any violations to the guidelines specified in this document.

## Coding Style

Consistency is the most important. Following the existing style, formatting, and naming conventions of the file you are modifying and of the overall project.
Failure to do so will result in a prolonged review process that has to focus on updating the superficial aspects of your code, rather than improving its
functionality and performance. Style and format will be enforced with a linter.
