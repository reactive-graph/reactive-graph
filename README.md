* Inexor will be a new first person shooter game which is based on a new octree-based game engine.
* Inexor focuses on classic gameplay as we've seen in Cube2 or the Quake series.
* Inexor will be written from ground up new in C++17 and Rust.
* You can contribute anything you want: code, content, ideas..
* Inexor and all its content is 100% open source!

### About Inexor Reactive Graph Flow

The Inexor Reactive Graph Flow (RGF) manages reactive flows based on a graph database. The main interface is GraphQL.

* Semantic: Graph database with entities and relationships as first class citizens
* Reactive: entities and relationships are/can be reactive: If the input has been altered the entity processes its new state
* Interoperable: Use GraphQL for queries and mutations
* Extendable: Built in type system: components, entity types and relation types
* Memory efficient: Rust
* Fast: Rust
* Secure: Rust

### About this module

This module provides the core data model of the reactive graph.
