The named property stores a value/document as JSON representation.

Each property is represented by it's name (String) and it's value. The value is
a representation of a JSON value/document. Therefore the value can be boolean,
number, string, array or an object. For more information about the data types
please look at https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/value/enum.Value.html
